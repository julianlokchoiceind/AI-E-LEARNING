# 🏗️ PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & CORE (Weeks 1-8)

## 🎯 **PHASE OBJECTIVES**

**Goal:** Create a working MVP with authentication, basic course management, video player, and initial AI integration.

**Team:** 2-3 developers (1 Senior Fullstack Lead, 1 Backend Dev, 1 Frontend Dev)

**Key Deliverable:** Working platform where users can register, login, create courses, watch videos, and get AI assistance.

---

## 🎯 **COMPLIANCE STATEMENT**

**"Luôn tuân thủ claude.me hoặc coding_rules"** - This phase ensures:

✅ **CLAUDE.md Compliance**: All patterns follow existing SaveStatusIndicator, useApiCall, useErrorHandler  
✅ **CODING_RULES.md Compliance**: Zero scope creep, copy-paste consistency from existing files  
✅ **Golden Rule**: ONLY change what's explicitly requested - extend existing patterns, don't create new ones  
✅ **Pattern Inheritance**: Loading states extend SaveStatusIndicator, API calls use existing useApiCall hook  
✅ **StandardResponse Integration**: All implementations work with existing StandardResponse pattern  

**🔥 GOLDEN RULE**: Copy exact patterns from existing files instead of creating new implementations.
