## 🚨 **STEP 7: COMMON PITFALLS & SOLUTIONS**

### **Technical Pitfalls:**
```
Problem: Environment setup complexity
Solution: Use provided setup script, test on clean environment

Problem: API integration issues
Solution: Use API mocking during development, test incrementally

Problem: Database performance issues
Solution: Implement proper indexing early, monitor query performance

Problem: Authentication complexity
Solution: Start with basic JWT, add OAuth gradually

Problem: AI integration challenges
Solution: Begin with simple AI calls, add complexity iteratively
```

### **Team Pitfalls:**
```
Problem: Unclear requirements
Solution: Reference CLAUDE.md constantly, clarify in standups

Problem: Scope creep
Solution: Strict adherence to phase plans, resist "improvements"

Problem: Technical debt accumulation
Solution: Dedicated refactoring time, code review standards

Problem: Knowledge gaps
Solution: Pair programming, documentation, external resources

Problem: Communication issues
Solution: Structured standups, clear task assignments
```
