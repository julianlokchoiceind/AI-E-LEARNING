# AS ANY Refactor Tracking

This directory contains all tools and tracking for removing `as any` from the codebase.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Capture Baseline (First Time Only)
```bash
npm run refactor:baseline
```

### 2. Check Current Status
```bash
npm run refactor:progress
# or use the shell script
./validate-refactor.sh
```

### 3. Start Refactoring
Follow the checklist in `as-any-checklist.md` phase by phase.

### 4. Test After Each Phase
```bash
npm run refactor:test:phase1  # After completing Phase 1
npm run refactor:test:phase2  # After completing Phase 2
# ... etc
```

### 5. Quick Validation
```bash
npm run refactor:quick  # Type check + count
```

## 📊 Available Commands

### Progress Tracking
- `npm run refactor:progress` - Show detailed progress dashboard
- `npm run refactor:count` - Count remaining `as any`
- `npm run refactor:status` - Git status

### Testing
- `npm run refactor:test:all` - Run all tests
- `npm run refactor:test:phase[1-7]` - Test specific phase
- `npm run refactor:check:types` - TypeScript check
- `npm run refactor:check:build` - Build check
- `npm run refactor:check:runtime` - Runtime check

### Validation
- `npm run refactor:validate:phase1` - Validate Phase 1 completion
- `npm run refactor:validate:final` - Final validation before merge

### Git Helpers
- `npm run refactor:diff` - Show changes from last commit
- `npm run refactor:status` - Show modified files

## ✅ Completion Criteria

Each phase is complete when:
1. All checklist items marked with [x]
2. Phase test passes (`npm run refactor:test:phaseX`)
3. No new TypeScript errors
4. Build succeeds

## 🛡️ Safety Guidelines

1. **Always test after changes**
   ```bash
   npm run refactor:quick
   ```

2. **Commit frequently**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "refactor(types): Phase X.Y - description"
   ```

3. **If something breaks**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 [file]  # Revert specific file
   git reset --soft HEAD~1     # Undo last commit
   ```

## 📈 Expected Timeline

- Phase 1: 1 hour (Type infrastructure)
- Phase 2: 2 hours (Browser APIs - 12 items)
- Phase 3: 2 hours (Response types - 15 items)
- Phase 4: 1.5 hours (Form/Events - 15 items)
- Phase 5: 1 hour (Error handling - 10 items)
- Phase 6: 0.5 hour (Badge variants - 4 items)
- Phase 7: 0.5 hour (Misc - 2 items)

**Total: ~8.5 hours** (reduced from 11 hours)

## 🎯 Current Status

Run `npm run refactor:progress` to see current status.
